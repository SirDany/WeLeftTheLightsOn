# _We Left The Lights On_

_A chill sci-fi exploration game about lonely colonies, broken toasters, and finding humanity in forgotten places._

## Synopsis

**We Left The Lights On** is a meditative, atmospheric sci-fi game about uncovering forgotten colonies, abandoned facilities, and the quiet persistence of machines.

You’re not a soldier, you're not a savior. You're just... wandering.  
On the edge of known space, among rusting outposts and overgrown greenhouses, you’ll explore what humanity left behind—and maybe leave something of your own.

And yes, the coffee machine still works.

## Excerpt: _The Képlos Outpost_

> They came in expecting mold, maybe a flickering light or two. What they got was steam.
>
> Hot steam.
>
> The airlock hissed open, and there it was: the unmistakable aroma of freshly ground coffee beans. The lights were on. The floor was swept. A lounge bot (model KEVIN-3) stood at attention near the corner, making polite small talk with a long-dead ficus.
>
> "Would you like a cup?" KEVIN-3 chirped, cheerful and crackling with speaker static.
>
> "There's... no one here," Mae muttered, scanning the room. "No people, no bodies."
>
> The coffee machine burbled. Another perfect pour.
>
> KEVIN-3 paused. "Incorrect. I am here."
>
> The crew exchanged a look.
>
> "Alright, Kevin," Mae said, taking the cup. "Tell us what happened here."
>
> The bot’s head tilted. "They left. But they said they'd be back."
>
> It had been 43 years.
>
> The coffee? Surprisingly good.
